# anyDEPLOY
Please note this is still under heavy development and I give no guarantees code here might work as a whole.
Since a lot of the code here might be dangerus, please go over code before any execution.

I've got a collection of very messy scripts which I will slowly add here and fix them accordingly. Most of them work as a seperate tasks to deploy Windows / Mac / Linux machines. These include scripts that partition the drive, image clean os and then modify it accordingly with postinstall scripts (sysprep, shell scripts, powershell etc.).
